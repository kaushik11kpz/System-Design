-Message Queue in Pizza Shop is an exmaple of Asynchronous Processing as the client do not need to wait continuosly fro response
-It helps in prioritise tasks
-Once there are multiple pizza shops/Servers and if any Server goes offline, now we have to redirect the order to other Servers.
How can we detect that offline Server and send its ordr to other Server judiciously?
-The issue is, once the Server goes down, the entire list of order goes down, so we need to have a database, which contains the 
list of orders i.e the list of each order of every Server is stored in that database.
-A Notifier is used to check heartbeat in each server frequently
-A Load Balancing is also used to ensure that there is no duplicacy in request to Servers along with ensuring the right amount of
load to each Server i.e Consistent Hashing ensures load balancing and avoid duplication of requests to Servers. 
-The combination of Notifier, Load Balancer, Heartbeat in one thing is called Message/Task Queue.
-Message/Task Queue takes tasks, persist them, assign them to the correct Server, wait for it to complete, if it is takin too long
for acknowledgement, it feels that Server is offline and assignes it to the next Server. Multiple strategies are done to assign it.
This is all encapsulated by a Message/Task Queue.
-This is an important task in System Design using Message/Task Queue to get work done easily so that you can encapsulate all the
complexity into just one thing.
-This is the fundamental concept of System Design
Ex- Rabbit MQ, JMS etc.
