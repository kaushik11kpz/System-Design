-Avantages of Monoliths
1.Good for small teams.
2.If load increase, monolith architecture horizontally scales out
3.Lesser moving parts, less complexity.
4.Less duplication of code for every service.
5.Faster calls as no Remote Procedure Calls(RPCs) only function calls.

-Disadvantages of Monoliths
1.New member need more time and more context to understand the architecture.
2.Deployments are complicated as no decoupled code, thus everyhring is affected for even small code changes.
3.Single point of failure. Too much responsibilty on each Server.


-Advantages of Microservices
1.Easier to scale.
2.Easier for newer member.
3.Parallel development is easy.
4.Easy deployment

-Disadvantages of Monoliths
1.Hard to design.
2.A good indicator for a microservice to not be a microservice if it is talking only to a single microservice.
3.Need skilled architects
