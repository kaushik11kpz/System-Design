# While doing System Design, we need to think about CAP Theorem at initial stage as it requires tradeoffs.
1. CAP Theorem is defined as a Desirable Property of Distributed System with replicated data.
C - Consistency
A - Availability
P - Partition Tolerance

2.Distributed System is a collection of autonomous computer systems that are physically separated but are 
connected by a centralized computer network that is equipped with distributed system software.
             
			 A
			/ \
		   B   C
A-Application
B-DB Node
C-DB Node
-In this distributed system, Application A can query from DB Node B and DB Node C.
-B and C are far apart but are syncing with each other, storing replicated data.
-Replicated data means, Data of B is replicated in C all time.

-CAP Theorem states that of all the three properties only 2 can be used at a time, meaning all three CAP properties in a distributed system cannot be used simultaneoulsy.
-Either CA or AP or CP can be used at a time in a distributed system.


2. Consistency 
-It means, the same data is available at both Data Node B and C.
-Meaning, If Application A, writes in Data B to change the value of k=4 to k=5, when Application A reads from Data Node C, value of k is 5 here too.
-Meaning Data Node B and Data Node C are maintaing consistency by syncing with each other.

3. Availability
-It states that both the Data Node B and C should atleast inform all the time.
-All nodes should respond. Response can be success or failure, but there should be a response from all the nodes.

4. Partition Tolerance
-It states that even there is a break in communication betweeen Node B and C, application should be able to query from both/all the Nodes.
-Even if B and C are unable to communicate, A should be able to query from both DBs.
-The crux is system should be up even after break in communication betweeen nodes.

5-Possible - CA, AP, CP
-Not Possible - CAP

6. Why we cannot use all 3 CAP properties together?
-When we try to design a distributed system with all 3 CAP properties:
A. If we implemement AP in CAP, these means that there is a break in communication between Node B and C, thus data replicating is not possible, thus on Consistency as C.
B. If we want to implemement Consistency C in CAP but there is a Partition Tolerance P in the system, we need to keep down a node A or C, thus even if there is a Partition Tolerance
Consistency C is maintained as same data data is retrieved when we do operations like write and read multiple times in DB. But since a node is down, Availability is not there.
Thus CP in CAP is implememented, Availability A is compromised. System is Up but with one node.
C. We can achieve CA in CAP but Partition Tolerance P, need to be sacrificed as with P in place, there can either be C or A. Otherwise whole system goes down.

7. When designing a system never tradeoff on Partition Tolerance.
-Thus either CP or AP is utilised.
