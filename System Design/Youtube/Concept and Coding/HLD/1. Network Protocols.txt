#1. Network Protocol
   -What is Client Server Model
   -Peer to Peer Model(and learn about web sockets)
   -HTTP vs TCP vs UDP vs FTP vs SMTP(POP,IMAP)
   -Examples

-Network Protocols defines the rule so that two system can communicate with each other.
-There are 7 layers in networking
-We will read about Application Layer and Transport Layer
1. Application Layer is divided into 2 parts
	A. Client Server Protocol
		1. HTTP - 1 connection is created
		2. FTP - 2 connections are created(Control Connection and Data Connection)
			-Data Connection connection can be disconnected
			-Control Connection always exists.
			-FTP Data Connection is not encrypted.
		3. SMTP/IMAP 
			-SMTP - Used for sending the mail
			-IMAP - Receiving/Accessing the mail
			-SMTP is used with IMAP
		4. WebSockets
	B. Peer to Peer Protocol
		1. WebRTC
2. In Client Server model, client makes a request and server gives a response back.
  -It is a One Way Communication.
  -Client always initiates talk with server.
  -HTTP, FTP, SMTP uses strategy.

3.WebSocket is different
-WebSocket is a bidirection network protocol.
-Both Client and Server can talk to each otherm first.
-WebSocket belongs to Client Server protocol.
-WebSocket is utilised whenever we want to design a messaging application like whatsapp, telegram as we want two way communication.
-Server needs to send information to client.

4.Peer to Peer Protocol
-All clients and server can talk with each other.
-WebRTC is peer to peer protocol.
-WebRTC used UDP, thus it is fast.

5. Tansport Layer/Network Layer uses 2 types of protocols.
	1. TCP/IP Protocol
         -A virtual connection maintained
	 -Data is converted into packets are transferred in sequences that packets follows ordering.
	 -Acknowledgement is given for eack packet.
	2. UDP/IP
	 -No connection is maintained.
	 -Data is divided into datagram and sent parallely
	 -No acknowledgement, sequences or ordering is done
	 -It is utilised in livestreaming and video calling
